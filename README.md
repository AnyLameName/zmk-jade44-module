# Jade44 - A ZMK Keyboard Module

The Jade44 keyboard is a bespoke keyboard, designed for a userbase of one. 
This repository contains a module for the [ZMK Firmware](https://zmk.dev/) Project that will enable you to build
a firmware for the Jade44.

It also defines a GitHub Actions Workflow that will automatically build the firmware when a change is pushed.
